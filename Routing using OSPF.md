**## Notes \& Skills Demonstrated ##**



\- Router / Switch / End device configuration

\- Troubleshooting

-- OSPF multi-area configuration

-- OSPF verification

-- Lab 2 required CDP to identify neighbors. The goal was to create a multi area OSPF network in which all computers could ping one another. PC6 was considered area 0 while all other LANs were considered area 1.
