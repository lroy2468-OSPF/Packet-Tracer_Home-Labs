## Notes & Skills Demonstrated ##

- The goal was to identify all router interfaces and allow computers to ping one another.
- Point to point links / Lan network configuration
- Identifying neighboring interfaces using CDP
- Initial pings were successful after troubleshooting. PC 1 wasn't able to ping any other user until P2P interfaces on R1 were correctly configured (they were switched originally during start up configuration).
