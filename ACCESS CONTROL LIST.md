-- ACL Configuration

-- DHCP Configuration

-- DNS

-- IP Addressing

-- The goal was to configure the network so that hosts could ping one another by IP Address and host name. Also to set an ACL to block LT2 and LT3 from pinging the server. The initial configuration allowed all hosts to communicate with the server. After DNS was turned to on within the server services a standard ACL was applied.
